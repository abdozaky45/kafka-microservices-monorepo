# Kafka Microservices Monorepo (Educational Example)

This repository is an **educational example** designed to help developers learn about building microservices with Node.js and Apache Kafka.

Key points about this project:
- It demonstrates a **simple microservices architecture** where services communicate asynchronously through Kafka topics.
- The project is organized as a **monorepo** using NX for managing multiple packages efficiently.
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** are used to containerize the services along with Kafka and Zookeeper, simplifying setup and local development.
- The focus is on **learning Kafka integration** and understanding how microservices can work together using message brokers.
- This is **not intended for production use**, but rather as a hands-on tutorial and reference implementation.

Feel free to explore, modify, and extend this project to deepen your understanding of microservices and event-driven architectures.
